# xray_custom_issue (Resource)

Provides an Xray custom issue event resource. See [Xray Custom Issue](https://jfrog.com/help/r/xray-how-to-formally-raise-an-issue-regarding-an-indexed-artifact) and [REST API](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/issues) for more details.

~>Due to JFrog Xray REST API behavior, when `component.vulnerable_versions` or `component.fixed_versions` are set, their values are mirrored in the `component.vulnerable_ranges` attribute, and vice versa. We recommend setting all the `component` attribute values to match to avoid state drift.
