# xray_operational_risk_policy (Resource)

Creates an Xray policy using V2 of the underlying APIs. Please note: It's only compatible with Bearer token auth method (Identity and Access => Access Tokens)

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "xray_operational_risk_policy" "min_risk" {

  project_key = "testproj"

  rule {
    name     = "op_risk_custom_rule"
    priority = 1

    criteria {
      op_risk_min_risk = "Medium"

- `rule` (Block Set) A list of user-defined rules allowing you to trigger violations for specific vulnerability or license breaches by setting a license or security criteria, with a corresponding set of automatic actions according to your needs. Rules are processed according to the ascending order in which they are placed in the Rules list on the Policy. If a rule is met, the subsequent rules in the list will not be applied. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `modified` (String) Modification timestamp

<a id="nestedblock--rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the rule
- `priority` (Number) Integer describing the rule priority. Must be at least 1

Optional:

- `actions` (Block Set) Specifies the actions to take once a security policy violation has been triggered. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--actions))

- `fail_build` (Boolean) Whether or not the related CI build should be marked as failed if a violation is triggered. This option is only available when the policy is applied to an `xray_watch` resource with a `type` of `builds`. Default value is `false`.
- `mails` (Set of String) A list of email addressed that will get emailed when a violation is triggered.
- `notify_deployer` (Boolean) Sends an email message to component deployer with details about the generated Violations. Default value is `false`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:
