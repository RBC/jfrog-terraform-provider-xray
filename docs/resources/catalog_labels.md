# xray_catalog_labels (Resource)

Manages JFrog Catalog labels and their assignments using the correct GraphQL API mutations. 

~> Requires JFrog Catalog service to be available.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "xray_catalog_labels" "basic" {
  labels = [
    { name = "lbl_basic_1", description = "Basic label 1" },
    { name = "lbl_basic_2", description = "Basic label 2" }
  ]
}

resource "xray_catalog_labels" "with_package_assignments" {
  labels = [
    { name = "pkg_label", description = "Label for packages" }
  ]

  package_assignments = [
    { label_name = "pkg_label", package_name = "express", package_type = "npm" },
    { label_name = "pkg_label", package_name = "lodash",  package_type = "npm" }
  ]
}

resource "xray_catalog_labels" "with_version_assignments_single" {
  labels = [
    { name = "ver_label_one", description = "Label for a single package version" }
  ]

  version_assignments = [
    { label_name = "ver_label_one", package_name = "lodash", package_type = "npm", versions = ["4.17.21"] }
  ]
}

resource "xray_catalog_labels" "with_version_assignments_bulk" {
  labels = [
    { name = "ver_label_bulk", description = "Label for multiple package versions" }
  ]

  version_assignments = [
    { label_name = "ver_label_bulk", package_name = "express", package_type = "npm", versions = ["4.17.0", "4.18.2"] }
  ]
}

resource "xray_catalog_labels" "combined" {
  labels = [
    { name = "combined_lbl", description = "Label used in both package and version assignments" },
    { name = "doc_label",     description = "Another label to demonstrate multiple labels" }
  ]

  package_assignments = [
    { label_name = "combined_lbl", package_name = "express", package_type = "npm" }
  ]

  version_assignments = [
    { label_name = "combined_lbl", package_name = "lodash", package_type = "npm", versions = ["4.17.21"] }

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import xray_catalog_labels.basic lbl_basic_1,lbl_basic_2
terraform import xray_catalog_labels.with_package_assignments pkg_label
terraform import xray_catalog_labels.with_version_assignments_single ver_label_one
terraform import xray_catalog_labels.with_version_assignments_bulk ver_label_bulk
terraform import xray_catalog_labels.combined combined_lbl,doc_label
```
